# 4X4-Web-ToDisplay
4x4 web application using React and Node.js to showcase our upcoming road trip and allow clients to register and join. The app will display trip details and offer a registration option, focusing mainly on the display aspect, with partial functionality for client sign-ups

## description 

This repository contains a partial project for a 4x4 web application designed to showcase our road trip and allow clients to register and join. The reason for the partial implementation is that I chose not to display everything. The frontend is built in React using JSX, while the backend is developed with Node.js, utilizing Express to handle routing and server logic. The server is connected to a MongoDB database to store client registration data

## Home Page

### Top Page

The first section of the application features a background video that enhances the visual appeal and sets the mood for the road trip. It includes prominent titles introducing the trip and a call-to-action button. When clicked, the button smoothly scrolls down to the section displaying the available road trips.

### Road-Trip Section

The road trips section showcases a series of cards, each with a short description of a specific trip. Clicking on any card redirects the user to a detailed trip page, where they can find more information and register for the adventure.
